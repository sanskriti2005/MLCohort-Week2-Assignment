# MLCohort-Week2-Assignment
Hey y'all! Welcome to my ML Cohort Week 2 assignment. It can always be better and I'm always striving to learn more ;)

**LinearRegression.ipynb**: Just linear regression being done on the score.csv file
<br>
**KNN.ipynb**: Made sense what exactly K nearest neighbor does on the T Shirt.csv dataset.
<br>
<br>
**Score.csv**: Scores and the corresponding hours of study. Used this dataset to work with a linear regression model
<br>
**T Shirt.csv**: A csv with the target variable as the size. I'm aiming to complete this using KNN, I think it's very cool, but it's also making me cry so lets see.
